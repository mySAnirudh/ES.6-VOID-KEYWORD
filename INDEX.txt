     >> The void keyword is used as the return type of functions that do not
      return any value. It evaluates the given expression and returns undefined.
       It is an important JavaScript keyword that might be used as a unary
        operator and appears before the single operand of any type.
      It specifies an expression to evaluate without returning any value.



      void is an important keyword in JavaScript which can be used as a unary operator that 
appears before its single operand, which may be of any type. This operator specifies an 
expression to be evaluated without returning a value. The operator evaluates a given 
expression and then returns undefined.
Following is the syntax for the same.

Void and Immediately InvokedFunction Expressions
When using an immediately-invoked function expression, void can be used to force the 
function keyword to be treated as an expression instead of a declaration. Consider the 
following example:
void function iife_void()
{
 var msg = function () {console.log("hello world")};
 msg();
}();
The following output is displayed on successful execution of the above code.
hello world
Void and JavaScriptURIs
The JavaScript: URI is a commonly encountered syntax in a HTML page. The browser 
evaluates the URI and replaces the content of the page with the value returned. This is 
true unless the value returned is undefined. The most common use of this operator is in a 
client-side JavaScript: URL, where it allows you to evaluate an expression for its sideeffects without the browser displaying the value of the evaluated expression.
Consider the following code snippet:
<a href="javascript:void(javascript:alert('hello world!!'))">
 Click here to do nothing
</a>
<br/><br/><br/>
<a href="javascript:alert('hello');">
 Click here for an alert
